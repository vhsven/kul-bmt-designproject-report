for each dataset
	load DICOM slices
	perform lungsegmentation
	load XML annotations
	for each nodule
		for each slice in nodule
			calculate center, r
			select positive pixels (d < r/3)
	for random pixel in segmented data
		if far enough from all nodules (d > 2r)
			add to negative pixels
	calculate features for selected pixels
	train classifier
