		load DICOM slices
		perform lungsegmentation -> mask
		load XML annotations
		for each nodule
			for each slice in nodule
				select positive pixels (d < r/3)
		for random pixel in volume
			if far enough from all nodules (d > 2r)
				add to negative pixels
		generate feature vectors for selected pixels
		train classifier with selected pictures
		generate feature vectors for non-masked all pixels in volume
		use classifier and generate probability volume
		mask <- pixels with p < 1% positive
