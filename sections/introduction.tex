\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to develop a fully automated algorithm for the
detection of lung nodules, based on assumptions about the shape and appearance of their
features. An algorithm based on machine learning techniques will be used to
tackle this goal. One of the challenges is the selection of the features. The
fact that some nodules are embedded in surrounding tissue (e.g.
lung wall, blood vessel, etc.) presents another important challenge.
