\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Introduction}
In Belgium one man in three and one woman in four faces cancer before his or
her 75th birthday \cite{kanker}. In 2010 62017 new cases of cancer were
diagnosed in Belgium \cite{kankerliga}. Lung cancer is the second most common
cander for men, and the third for women.
On top of that, it is one of the deadliest cancers
\cite{zheng}. However, an early detection can increase the survival rate up to 70-80\%
\cite{swensen}. Furthermore, research has shown that the detection of lung
cancer in an early stage broadens the amount of treatment options and increases
the amount of invasive surgery\cite{greenlee}.


Due to recent developments in
computed tomography (CT) technology it is now possible to obtain near isotropic, submillimeter resolution images of the complete chest in a single breath hold.
This high resolution has the advantage that it enables visualisation of small
and low-contrast nodules that could hardly be screened in conventional
programs. The downside is that enormous amounts of data are generated
which increases the work load of radiologists, especially since low-dose CT
scans are more and more implemented in routine screenings. Still, this is no
idle measure. Long nodules are very commonly detected on CT scans. Research
shows that up to 51\% of smokers aged 50 years or older have pulmonary lung nodules on CT scans \cite{mahon}.
Therefore, the United States Preventive Services Task Force for example stated that it ``recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit
within the past 15 years'' \cite{ups}.
Therefore, the detection of pulmonary nodules from volumetric computed
tomography (CT) scans if one of the most studied CAD applications
\cite{sluimer}.


Currently, expert radiologists perfrom the investigation of the
CT scans. They use the shape, the texture, the location and the growth rate of
the volume of the nodule as clinical parameter to determine the malignancy of
the nodules and to decide on the diagnosis of lung cancer. A jagged shape
nodule is more likely to be lung cancer than a smoothed one. A fatty, bony,
watery nodule or a mixture of these different contents is less likely to
indicate lung cancer than a nodule that is attached to a vessel. A lung wall
attached nodule is typically diagnosed as benign if the volume-doubling periode
is longer than 400 days \cite{wu}. Nevertheless, the examination of these scans
is a time-consuming task and is not free from errors. Although small nodules are
in principle detectable in CT scans, a non-negligible fraction may be overlooked
if they are situated in a maze of vessels of similar size \cite{ozekes}.

Another problem that arises is the intra- and interreader variability
amongst radiologists in pulmonary lung detection \cite{armato} \cite{hens}. Therefore,
there is a need for a computer-aided detection (CAD) system that can assist the
radiologist in the detection of pulmonary nodules.

\subsection{The biology of lung nodules}
FIGUUR vanginneken
Lung nodules are lung tissue abnormalities that are roughly spherical with a
diameter up to 30 mm. On chest CT scans they appear as a rounded or
irregular opacity. Many types of lung nodules can by distinguished on CT scans.
A centrilobular nodule is separated by several millimeters from the pleural surfaces, fissures and
interlobular septa. They range in size from a few millimeters to 10 millimeters.
A micronodule is less than 3 millimeters in diameter. A ground-glass nodule -or
non-solid nodule- appears on the CT scans as a hazy attenuation in the lung.
This type of nodule does not efface the bronchial and vascular margins. A solid
nodule shows a homogenous soft-tissue attenuation. Finally, a part-solid nodule
exhibits both ground-glass and solid soft-tissue attenuation characteristics
\cite{nodule}. 

The types of nodules stated above can again be categorised. Juxta-vascular
pulmonary nodules have significant connections to their neighbouring vessels.
Pleural tail nodules have only thin connections to the neighbouring pleural
wall. Well-circumscribed nodules on the other hand do not have a connection to
the neighbouring vessels and structures. Juxta-pleural nodules show some degree
of attachment to their neighbouring pleural surface \cite{kostis}.

A number of nodule segmentation algorithms perform well in detecting specific
types of nodules e.g. large, spherical, isolated nodules. However, these CAD
systems show large limitations in detecting e.g. non-isolated nodules that are
connected to the pulmonary wall \cite{keshani}. These algorithms can be usefull
in particular situations, but if a detection algorithms really aims at being an
asset for the radiologist, it should be able to detect all nodules while
refusing as much false positives as possible.

\subsection{Overview of the existing lung nodule detection systems}
As the demand for a reliable CAD system to detect pulmonary nodules is urgent, a
lot of research has been dedicated to the matter. Several commercial systems
have already been developed and many workstations that radiologists use to
examinate CT scans offer on-board nodule detection or enhancement capabilities
\cite{ginneken}.

In 2004 iCAD, Inc., provided lung cancer detection, analysis and tracking
software for the TeraRecon's Aquarius product line. The latter licensed three
software modules from iCAD. The iCAD QuickCueTM for example automatically
detects cancerous lung nodules while the iCAD QuickMatchTM locates, compares and tracks these
nodules in previous or subsequent patient studies \cite{tera}.
However, the ImageChecker CT, launched by R2 Technology, was the first CT Lung
CAD system approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the detection of
lung nodules during the examination of CT scans \cite{Mevis}. In 2005 R2
Technology, Inc., introduced the second-generation ImageChecker CT Lung Version 2.0 CAD system which also implemented the AutoPoint temporal comparison algorithm. This CAD system ``highlights abnormalities'' and compares new and past images to
demonstrate changes that have occured over time \cite{diag} \cite{r2}.
In 2006 Vital Images, Inc., and R2 Technology, Inc., announced the
implementation of the R2 Technology's ImageChecker CT Lung CAD software into
the Vitrea workstations \cite{vital}. In 2006 anohter company, Hologic, Inc.,
acquired R2 Technology, Inc., and implemented their CAD technology
\cite{Hologic}. Then, in 2008, MeVis Medical Solutions AG, Inc., acquired the
Pulmonary Computed Tomography Business from Hologic R2, Inc. \cite{Mevis}. 


Although the technology from R2 Technology is highly demanded, some companies
have also developed their own software. In 2007 Medicsight plc announced it was
granted a medical device license from the Therapeutic Products Directorate of
Health in Canada to introduce Medicsight LungCAD API \cite{HI}.
Median Technologies offers the LMS-Lung and LMS-Lung/CAD modules which provide
quantification and detection functionalities for pulmonary (solid) nodules and
micronodules \cite{median}. And Siemens has developed the syngo.CT Lung CAD.
They claim it is ``a fully automated computer assisted second reader tool'' that is designed to assist radiologists in
the detection of solid pulmonary nodules \cite{siemens}.

Apart from these numerous commercial systems also a lot of research centra
have tried to come up with a successful pulmonary nodule detection system. The
algorithms presented in a wide range of papers report however varying successes
in the automated detection of nodules.
